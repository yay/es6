/*
Backtracking is a systematic way to iterate through all the possible configurations
of a search space. These configurations may represent all possible arrangements
of objects (permutations) or all possible ways of building a collection of them
(subsets). Other situations may demand enumerating all spanning trees of a graph,
all paths between two vertices, or all possible ways to partition vertices into
color classes.
